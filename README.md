# SetGame2020
Swift UI version of [game of SET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) as specified in [Assignment 3 of Stanford CS193P Spring 2020](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj16636/files/media/file/assignment_3.pdf)

## Objective 

The goal of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to create your first app
completely from scratch by yourself. It is similar enough to the first two assignments
that you should be able to find your bearings, but different enough to give you the full
experience! 

## Required Tasks

1. Implement a game of solo (i.e. one player) Set. 
```diff 
+ Status: done
```
2. When your game is run for the very first time, there should briefly be no cards
showing, but as soon as it appears, it should immediately deal 12 cards by having them
“fly in” from random off-screen locations. 
```diff 
+ Status: done
```
